# Epic & User Stories

__Note:__

A 'Use Case' is a description of how a person who uses that process or system will accomplish a goal. It needs to have:

- Actor: which is the user, which can be a single person or a group of people, interacting with a process
- System: which is the process that's required to reach the final outcome
- Goal: which is the successful user outcome

## User Story
```
A user story is a tool used in Agile software development to capture a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. 
A user story describes the type of user, what they want and why. A user story helps to create a simplified description of a requirement.

### Use Case for User Stories:
A team developing a messaging app, working in an agile environment could utilise a user story to understand what users pay attention so and what their preferences are for the UI,in order to succefully create a beautiful application. 


## Epic Story 

```
An epic is a large user story that cannot be delivered as defined within a single iteration or is large enough that it can be split into smaller user stories.

### Use Case for Epic Stories:
A team developing a webapp using agile methodology can keep some aspects of the projects as epics instead of breaking them down straight away into user stories. This can avoid confusion and limit the amount of 'details' that the team has to worry about until it is time to implement that part of the project. This would enable the team to focus on the tasks of the current sprint and not get ahead of themselves.
