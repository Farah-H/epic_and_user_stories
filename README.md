# Epic & User Stories

__Note:__

A 'Use Case' is a description of how a person who uses that process or system will accomplish a goal. It needs to have:

- Actor: which is the user, which can be a single person or a group of people, interacting with a process
- System: which is the process that's required to reach the final outcome
- Goal: which is the successful user outcome

## User Story

### Definition:

__A user story is a tool used in Agile software development to capture a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. 
A user story describes the type of user, what they want and why. A user story helps to create a simplified description of a requirement.__

### Use Case for User Stories:
A team working with an Agile methodology to develop a messaging app, could center a week-long sprint around a user story detailing the visual design requirements for their app. This will enable them to focus on what the users' preferences are in order to successfully create a beautiful application. 


## Epic Story 

### Definition: 

__An epic is a large user story that cannot be delivered as defined within a single iteration or is large enough that it can be split into smaller user stories.__

### Use Case for Epic Stories:
A team developing a web-app using Agile methodology can keep some aspects of the project as epics instead of breaking them down straight away into user stories. This can avoid confusion and limit the amount of 'details' that the team has to worry about until it is time to implement that part of the project, enabling the team to focus on the tasks of the current sprint and not get ahead of themselves in order to successfully avoid mistakes. 

## How User Stories and Epic Stories Fit into Agile & Scrum:

For a team working using Agile methodology, stories are something the team can commit to finish within a one or two-week sprint. Stories in this context are short requirements written from the perspective of a user.

 Epics take longer to complete. Teams often have two or three epics they work to complete each quarter. Epics in this context are 'large bodies of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller tasks (called stories)'.
